OddsCalculator
==============

Determine the bookmaker's odds based on percentage chance of winning.

Rather than having to check a betting chart again and again, this simple website allows you to input a percentage and the bookmaker's fractional odds will be displayed.

For example, if you think a horse has a 50% chance of winning it should only be backed if the bookmaker's odds are greater than evens.
If you think a horse has a 10% chance of winning it should only be backed if the bookmaker's odds are greater than 9-1.
If you think a horse has a 27% chance of winning it should only be backed if the bookmaker's odds are greater than 11-4.
